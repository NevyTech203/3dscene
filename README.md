# 3dscene

Recall that you work as a C++ and OpenGL 3D graphics developer for Triangle & Cube Studios. This company designs 3D worlds for clients and customizes them based on the varied needs presented by each particular client.

In this professional landscape, the demand for computational graphics and visualizations is continually growing. Your clients may come from the game industry looking for graphics and animations, the healthcare industry for medical visualizations, the entertainment industry for computer-generated imagery (CGI) and visual effects, business industries for 3D printing to create physical objects for applied real-world problem solving, and much more. When you are assigned one of these types of projects, you become responsible for writing code in OpenGL to create objects, apply texture, apply light, render, and control virtual environments relative to a virtual camera.

Your current project with Triangle & Cube Studios is to recreate a 3D version of a 2D image that you have been given by a client. Your client will later be 3D printing this to use as a preliminary concept for their business, so they only need you to create a simple approximation using a few basic shapes.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
1) Due to this project I was able to obtain the skill of making a 2d object into a 3d object.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
2) I followed a simple color design process.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
3) The tactics I used will help me approach my future graphic classes with a little experience. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
4) the whole project was new for me. The part that I haven't done before was code an object, like a triangle.

How did iteration factor into your development?
5) Iteration was important to my development due to the location process. It is not easy placing objects in different spots within the scene.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
6) The only way to tackle a code this large is in moderation. I approached this code with a little every day.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
7) Computer science will be the very foundation in me reaching my goal of working for a space company or the government. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
8) It gave me an insight into how graphics are made. Now when I watch an animated show, I cannot help but think what goes into creating it. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
9) It gives me the need to learn more and go further than I thought possible. It gives me a sense of wonder about being a person who creates animation for TV or movies.
